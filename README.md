Hi There !! 
This is our very first Python project and we are very proud about it.

# Masar
## What is Masar ?
Masar is built to enrich our lives and enlarge our understanding of Palestinian history,
while creating for us a sense of continuity through outdoor trips to historical landmarks which strengthens
the roots of Palestinian identity, through observing the beauty of nature in our beloved holy homeland.

## About us ? 
This Website was designed by three enthusiastic junior Web-Devlopers, The idea of JobPal came from the need for a platform where Job opportunities can be offered and exchanged. We encourage all the users of the platform to reach out to all the companies registered on the website. Life is all about opportunities. We hope that this Website will be the seed for all Job seekers who are trying to find a place to belong, a place where people can grow professionally and reflect on their Careers, We wish you all the luck in the world !
